## What does it do?

It downloads newsfeeds and stores them in a local maildir,
so that you can read them with your mail client.

## How to install?

Assuming rss2maildir.py is in your PATH and you use the default config location
install the script by adding

0    *    *    *    *    rss2maildir.py > /dev/null

into you crontab.

## Dependencies

The python3 modules that are required are:

feedparser
mailbox

All other modules should be part of the standard library.
This script is python 3 only.

## Configuration

rss2maildir takes a configuration file that is located at ~/.config/rss2maildir.json.
For situations where your config is located else where use the '-c' parameter.

### The configuration file

An annotated config lookes like this:

    {
        # General options
        "general": {
            # The "base" directory for all feeds
            "maildir": "~/.mail/rss",
            # Where to store information between script runs
            "cache": "~/.cache/rss2maildir/",
            # Use mails as a cache instead of local files
            "use_maildir_cache": true,
            # Should all mails be stored in a single Maildir
            "use_single_maildir": true,
            # What to put to the "From" field
            "mail_sender": "noreply@localhost"
        },
        # list of subscriptions
        "feeds": [
            {
                # used to identify feeds, Maildir name under "base" directory
                "name": "rss2maildir",
                "url": "https://github.com/edt-devel/rss2maildir/commits/master.atom"
            },
            {
                "name": "HackerNews",
                "url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/rss",
                "maildir": "~/.mail/rss/news", # use this maildir
                "links": true # keep links in the message text
            }
        ]
    }
